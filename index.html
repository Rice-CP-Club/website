  Competitive programming is a mind sport in which participants design programs
  to solve well-specified programming problems under given time and system
  constraints. The goal of our club is to promote competitive programming by
  organizing contests, registering students for external competitions, and
  running practice sessions. We also sometimes organize lectures covering
  algorithmic concepts relevant to the field.

  Importantly, Rice University competes in the annual

    >ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest</a
  >. We are located in the South Central USA region, consisting of Texas,
  Louisiana, and Oklahoma.

  Three students, one computer, five hours, and a bunch of problems. Solve as
  many as you can, as fast as you can. Students have approximately-weekly
  practice sessions in the fall to practice for the Regional contest. From
  there, top teams advance to the North American Championship. And from there,
  top teams advance to the World Finals.
