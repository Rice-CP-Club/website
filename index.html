  Three students, one computer, five hours, and a bunch of problems. Solve as
  many as you can, as fast as you can. Students have approximately-weekly
  practice sessions in the fall to practice for the Regional contest. From
  there, top teams advance to the North American Championship. And from there,
  top teams advance to the World Finals.
